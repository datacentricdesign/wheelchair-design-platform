Wheelchair Design Platform is a repository that contains some resources to help
designers and developers speak the same language, and work together towards
addressing relevant challenges for wheelchair users. It is a collection of
workshop materials, code examples and also a compilation of resources to foster
a prospering research and design community around wheelchair users.

## Workshops

* [Getting started](/docs/workshops/GettingStarted.md)
* [Workshop 1: Building an Internet-Connected Wheelchair](/docs/workshops/Workshop1.md)
* [Workshop 2: Integrating and Visualising Sensor-Based Data](/docs/workshops/Workshop2.md)
* [Workshop 3: Developing Algorithms and Controlling Actuators](/docs/workshops/Workshop3.md)
* [Workshop 4: Developing and Conducting a Data Collection Campaign](/docs/workshops/Workshop4.md)
* [Workshop 5: Implementing a Machine Learning Pipeline](/docs/workshops/Workshop5.md)
* [Workshop 6: Developing a Product Analytics Dashboard](/docs/workshops/Workshop6.md)

## Resources

* This platform uses two programming languages, Python on computers and C on
micro-controllers. While descriptions and examples of code should help you
get started, you can find some additional resources
[here](/docs/resources/software.md "Python and C resources").

* Documentation of your project is key,
[here are some tips and examples](/docs/resources/documentation.md "Documentation tips and examples").

* [Git manipulation such as Pull Request](/docs/resources/git.md "Git manipulation").

## Main Components

__**Disclaimer:**__ the design of this platform focuses on flexibility and
technology exploration rather than optimisation.

The main design includes a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino Mega 2560 on the wheelchair frame.

The Arduino Mega is the micro-controller of the platform. Fixed on the main frame of the wheelchair,
it can collect data from sensors (e.g. force sensors, accelerometers), and trigger actions from actuators
(e.g. LEDs, vibration motors).

More on the Arduino Mega can be found [here](/docs/resources/arduino.md "Arduino resources").

Raspberry Pi is a small computer. It is also fixed to the main frame of the wheelchair,
where it can:
* interact with the Arduino Mega via USB to receive data and transmit commands;
* interact with the Internet to transmit commands and receive data;
* store data locally in files;
* run (machine learning) algorithms.

More on the Raspberry Pi can be found [here](/docs/resources/raspberrypi.md "Raspberry Pi resources").

These components fit together as shown on the following diagram. A large powerbank
powers the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino Mega communicates and receives power from the
Raspberry Pi via USB. A Feather (Arduino-like development board) on the wheel connects to
the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth to sense and actuate from the wheel.
